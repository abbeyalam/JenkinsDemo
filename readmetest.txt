This is a test to show that Abeda knows how to make a readme file on Github.

The Scientific Method

You first click on add new file. 
You then name your file. 
Then commit. 

You created a Test Jenkins job called "JenkinsDemo"
You added your GitHub credentials to Jenkins by using the prompts after Manage Credentials
In which you configured the SCM to be Git
Linked the Github Repo URL and the Github Credentials

You created a GitHub today & created a repository named JenkinsDemo. 
Within the repository you created a readme file. 
Created a second readMe file to verify you can
Edited the second readMe file
And then you are going to commit the changes.

You then will go to TestJob in Jenkins
You will build the job
Check the Output Console for any issues
If success, you will see: 

In your File Directory /Jenkins/workspace a file called TestJob
Which has a readme.txt file 
And a readmetest.txt files 

You realized a few things about yourself during this time: 
You crave/love attention especially from someone you like, and they like you back -- especially in the oddest of circumstances
It's that weird rom com movie moment
The movie is surrounded by you and your relationships
But life is so much bigger than you
Yet you crave attention from a lover, friends, family 

Anime music playing softly in a lecture helps you study. 
My Hero Academia Soundtrack is good - Emotional & Epic Anime Music
Anime makes grown men cry 
That's the key 
Rap makes grown men cry
This ReadMe is going to make me cry

Good job Abi!
